          <h1> Background Story : </h1>
          <p> 
            Eren Yeager is introduced as a ten-year-old residing in the town of Shiganshina who dreams of joining the Survey Corps in order to explore the outside world beyond the walls. A year prior to the events of the story, accompanying his father Grisha to meet her parents, Eren helps Mikasa Ackerman in dispatching her kidnappers, while developing his ideology at a young age.[20] When the Titans invade Shiganshina, Eren is forced to watch his mother be devoured by one of the Titans and thus vows to kill every Titan henceforth.[21] Eren then enlist himself in the military.[21] During his first mission at Trost, Eren sacrifices himself to save his friend Armin Arlert from being swallowed by a bearded Titan.[22] Eren manages to transform into a Titan himself, proving his newfound strength worthy to fight for mankind.[23] Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a branch of Survey Corps under Captain Levi.[24][25] Eren is hunted by a female Titan but is saved by Levi and Mikasa. The Titan is later revealed to be his classmate Annie Leonhart, who is defeated by Eren but freezes herself. Upon being chased by more of Annie's allies, Eren awakens a power known as the "Founding Titan" (始祖の巨人, Shiso no Kyojin), which he subconsciously uses to direct a group of Titans to attack them.[26]
            Soon after, Eren is sent with his friends to an isolated village while preparations are made for a campaign to retake Wall Maria. Eren is then captured by Rod Reiss, who reveals the Founding was originally in his family for years since their ancestor Karl Fritz created the walls, and that the Reiss family used it to rule until it was stolen by Grisha. Grisha is revealed to be responsible for Eren becoming a Titan and was eaten by his son in the past unconsciously. Eren's classmate Krista Lenz, who is actually Rod's child Historia, refuses to aid her father and frees Eren. Eren and the Survey Corps depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria and defeat an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beast Titan, and his subordinates Bertolt and Reiner.[27] With Shiganshina secured,[28] Eren and his friends learn of Grisha's past: Zeke is revealed to be Eren's half brother and Grisha's first son, and they are revealed to have originated in another nation named Marley. They learn that humanity exists beyond the walls and that their true enemy is Marley, while they live on an island called Paradis Island, and are a race called Eldians (specifically the "Subjects of Ymir"), descendants of the original titan shifter Ymir Fritz and that in the past as her power split into the Nine Titans that would be passed down to her people it was used to conquer and subjugate many races and nations in the past, including Marley who overthrew Eldia and took control of Seven of the Nine Titans, before oppressing and demeaning Eldians left on the continental mainland and using them as holders of the titan powers acquired to conquer and subjugate other nations as the Eldian Empire had once done in the past. Eren learns that he has a limited lifespan as a side effect of being a holder of two of the Nine Titans' power, including the titular "Attack Titan" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin),[29] along with the Founding Titan, only having 8 years left to live.
            Four years later, assumed to have been fending off Marleyan infiltrators with the new Colossal Titan Armin, Eren is leading the Survey Corps in an extraction of Zeke in Liberio following Marley having won its war with the Mid-East Allied Forces. Having his left leg amputated, Eren assumes the identity of "Mr. Kruger" (クルーガーさん, Kurūgā-san), a former Marleyan military officer.[30] During the festival held by Willy Tybur to declare war on Paradis, Eren responds with an attack, killing Willy and then devouring his sister to gain the War Hammer Titan's power.[31] Eren's actions result in his arrest but he escapes with a group of Survey Corps members loyal to him called "Yeagerists", and he resumes his search for Zeke.[32] Eren makes himself known to Armin and Mikasa, showing antagonism for his friends, and is ambushed by a group of soldiers led by Reiner. Eren attempts to reach Zeke to activate the Founding Titan's power, but is nearly killed by Gabi; Zeke saves his brother but turns out to be the one who has control of the Founding Titan's power because as a member of the royal family that wasn't descended from the first king of the walls he wasn't brainwashed by the latter's will and because Ymir Fritz, the source of the Founding Titan's power was bound as a slave to her royal descendants. Eren convinces Ymir to help him after giving her the choice to make her own decision. Revived, Eren frees the Titans within the Walls and declares his intent to exterminate all life outside Paradis in order to protect his people, becoming the world's enemy; the Titans destroy much of Marley before a team led by Armin kills Zeke, stopping the Rumbling, and severs Eren's connection to the source of the Titans[33] before Eren is mortally decapitated by Mikasa. After Eren's death, Armin recovers his lost memories of a conversation where Eren reveals his true plan, which was to have his friends being celebrated as saviors for killing him. Ymir's power is removed from the world after she witnessed what Eren did in his love for Mikasa and returned all surviving Titans and Titan Shifters to human form permanently. Having destroyed most of the world's population and assets, he helped to prevent any major attempt of retaliation against Paradis or the Eldian race. His head is buried under a tree in a place only known by Mikasa and Armin.
